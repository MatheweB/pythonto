## About PythonTo
PythonTo is a user-driven website that aims to teach people different coding languages through the eyes of Python (the greatest language to have lived)

The concept is simple: Python code on the left, `<insert language>` code on the right. Through comparison, the goal is that you will be able to learn how to code in the other language through a common frame of reference.
